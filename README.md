## Project History

Geo Pres is a program that was born out of boredom. Our geography teacher gave us an optional assignment: create a presentation showcasing all Polish cities by voivodeship for extra credit. We decided to take it a step further and build something that processes data from GUS (Central Statistical Office of Poland), automatically fetches photos and coats of arms from Wikipedia, generates "entries" and assembles them into complete slides.
